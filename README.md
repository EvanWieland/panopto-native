# PanonptoNative Chrome Extension
View Panopto embedded videos in your browser's native media player.

> ðŸš§ This Extension was made for Bradley University students specifically. To get it to work for different university, just change the Panopto host address in the manifest.json file. If you aren't sure what to replace it with, submit an issue and I'll help you out.

I hate Panopto and its embedded media player. That's why I took the time to build this extension.

With PanonptoNative, you get these ***amazing*** features:
* Better buffering
* Download
* Picture-in-picture
* Etc!

To use, just download the code and load the extension in Chrome. Make sure you have developer mode checked! Check out this [article](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) if you're nopt sure how to do this.

To launch PanonptoNative, just click on the embedded Panopto player's big play button.
